//Ends with s
//Create a function called countWordsEndsWithS that takes a string as an input 
//and returns the number of the words, that ends with s in it.
//Example case:
//countWordsEndsWithS("ends with s characters");
//Should return 3, because "ends with s characters".
//Example case:

//1 3 6 2
//4 5 6 1
//3 3 1 5
//9 0 5 2
//The result should be:

//1  3  6  2
//8  5  12 1
//3  3  1  5
//9  0  5  4
